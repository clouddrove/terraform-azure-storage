We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-storage/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "storage" {
    depends_on                = [module.resource_group]
    source                    = "clouddrove/storage/azure"
    name                      = "app"
    environment               = "test"
    label_order               = ["name", "environment"]
    resource_group_name       = module.resource_group.resource_group_name
    location                  = module.resource_group.resource_group_location
    storage_account_name      = "storagestartac"
    account_kind              = "StorageV2"
    account_tier              = "Standard"
    account_replication_type  = "GRS"
    enable_https_traffic_only = true
    is_hns_enabled            = true
    sftp_enabled              = true

    network_rules = [
      {
          default_action = "Deny"
          ip_rules       = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
          bypass         = ["AzureServices"]
      }
    ]


    ##   Storage Account Threat Protection
    enable_advanced_threat_protection = true

    ##   Storage Container
    containers_list = [
      { name = "app-test", access_type = "private" },
    ]

    ##   Storage File Share
    file_shares = [
      { name = "fileshare1", quota = 5 },
    ]

    ##   Storage Tables
    tables = ["table1"]

    ## Storage Queues
    queues = ["queue1"]

    management_policy = [
      {
        prefix_match               = ["app-test/folder_path"]
        tier_to_cool_after_days    = 0
        tier_to_archive_after_days = 50
        delete_after_days          = 100
        snapshot_delete_after_days = 30
      }
    ]
}

  ```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| access\_tier | Defines the access tier for BlobStorage and StorageV2 accounts. Valid options are Hot and Cool. | `string` | `"Hot"` | no |
| account\_kind | The type of storage account. Valid options are BlobStorage, BlockBlobStorage, FileStorage, Storage and StorageV2. | `string` | `"StorageV2"` | no |
| account\_replication\_type | Defines the type of replication to use for this storage account. Valid options are LRS, GRS, RAGRS, ZRS, GZRS and RAGZRS. Changing this forces a new resource to be created when types LRS, GRS and RAGRS are changed to ZRS, GZRS or RAGZRS and vice versa. | `string` | `""` | no |
| account\_tier | Defines the Tier to use for this storage account. Valid options are Standard and Premium. For BlockBlobStorage and FileStorage accounts only Premium is valid. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | `"Standard"` | no |
| containers\_list | List of containers to create and their access levels. | `list(object({ name = string, access_type = string }))` | `[]` | no |
| enable\_advanced\_threat\_protection | Boolean flag which controls if advanced threat protection is enabled. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| enable\_https\_traffic\_only | Boolean flag which forces HTTPS if enabled, see here for more information. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
